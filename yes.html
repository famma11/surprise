                Abubakr, thank you so much for everything you've done for me. Thank you for being there for me even right now, when things are 
                hard for you. You have to manage stuff there as well, you probably get very tired also, maybe even stressed at times yet you still
                take out the time n message me n update me n talk to me. Thank you so much for it. 
                Also, wanted to say that, I love you so much. More than anything bro. You just mean so much to me which can not be explained in words.
                I just wanna let you know that you're too good abubakr. You're seriously too good. I love you so much. I just can't wait to marry you now.
                Just want that we both keep praying n get married ASAP. 🩷
                Also, had to say that.....Happy Birthday! 😅 I had planned this Website thing from a long time n was tryna make it from long. Didn't 
                tell you either before, cuz wanted to give you a small little surprise......but got sick n all, couldn't make on time. 🥲
                But, anyways, here you go! I really hope you like it 💗💗💗💗💗

                Also, wanted to kinda apologize as well. I'm sorry, I get k you're busy n tired n all, n then on top of it me always saying k i'm 
                not well or not good or 'fine' etc, you might not like it n all. So, Im really sorry about it, just im sorry. But thank you for listening to 
                me then also! I realize that at times, you may not be in the mood of that. I'm sorry. Maybe, at the time, I also don't realize it. Rest, just 
                wanna say k I LOVE YOU SO MUCH. JUST SO SO SO SO SOOOO MUCH!
